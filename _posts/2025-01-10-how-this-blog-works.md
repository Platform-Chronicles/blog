## Why I'm Doing This

I wanted a portfolio that shows actual work, not resume buzzwords - real implementations I can point to when I say "here's how I solved this."
At work you're constrained by reality, but this project lets me experiment and implement things properly from scratch.
The format forces me to follow through instead of just thinking about problems. I have to present the situation, identify the problem, and actually deliver a solution.
Using a narrative approach gives the project coherence. Through characters I can represent different stakeholders in a natural way, making the technical decisions feel grounded without it feeling forced.
And honestly? This is my excuse to experiment with AI - not just use it passively but really explore what works and what doesn't.

## How the Blog Works

The tech stack is deliberately simple - Jekyll generates static pages, GitHub Actions deploys them, and GitHub Pages hosts them. Everything is just text files in Git.
When I push changes they go live automatically, and the whole thing costs nothing to run.
This IS a proper solution to me - simple and effective, just write and publish. I keep ownership of the content instead of investing in someone else's platform.
The technical details are in the [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/Platform-Chronicles/blog), but there's not much to it - that's the point.

## The Reality

I'm making this up as I go, and every time I have a new idea I fight the urge to rewrite everything that came before. Sometimes I lose that fight.
I'm trying to be consistent but I'm definitely messing it up. I have big plans and then I procrastinate because starting is hard and perfection is paralyzing.
But I'm having so much fun with this it almost feels illegal.
So yeah, that's what this is. Hope you enjoy it.
