## Why I'm Doing This

I wanted a portfolio that shows actual platform engineering work - not just buzzwords on a resume, but real implementations I can point to and say "here's how I solved this problem."

At work, you're constrained by existing systems, tech debt, politics, budget. This project lets me experiment with technologies I don't get to use day-to-day and actually implement things properly from scratch.

The format forces me to follow through: present the situation, identify the problem, deliver the solution. Not just think about it or plan it - actually do it. Having that structure keeps me honest.

The narrative aspect gives this coherence. Instead of random disconnected technical posts, there's a thread running through everything. The characters represent different stakeholders - product people, operations, developers - without it feeling forced or artificial. They make the technical decisions feel grounded in real concerns.

And honestly? This is my excuse to experiment with AI tools. Not just use them passively, but really explore what they're good at and where they fall short. Learning by doing.

## How the Blog Works

The tech stack is deliberately simple: Jekyll for static site generation, GitHub Actions for deployment, GitHub Pages for hosting. Everything is text-based Markdown files, version controlled in Git.

A bit of automation makes it public automatically when I push changes. The whole thing costs nothing to run.

This IS a proper solution - simple and effective. No databases, no servers, no maintenance. Just write and publish.

I'm keeping ownership of the content instead of investing time and energy into someone else's platform that might change their terms or shut down tomorrow.

If you want the technical details, they're all in the [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/Platform-Chronicles/blog). But really, there's not much to it - which is exactly the point.

## The Reality

I'm making this up as I go. Every time I have a new idea, I fight the urge to go back and rewrite everything that came before. Sometimes I lose that fight.

I'm trying to be consistent with the narrative structure, the technical approach, the writing style. I'm definitely messing it up.

I have these big ambitious plans for where this project will go, and then I procrastinate implementing them because starting is hard and perfection is paralyzing.

But I'm having so much fun with this it almost feels illegal. Building things, writing about them, experimenting with new approaches, learning in public.

So yeah. That's what this is. Hope you enjoy reading it as much as I'm enjoying making it.
