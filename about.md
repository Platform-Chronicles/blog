# About Platform Chronicles

**Platform Chronicles** is a portfolio project demonstrating platform engineering expertise through narrative-driven technical blog posts with working code and real tests.

## The Project

This is not just a blog. It's a complete platform engineering portfolio that shows how to evolve a system from a simple monolith to a production-grade platform, one chapter at a time.

**Setting:** Barcelona, Catalonia-based restaurant tech platform

**Format:** Story + Working Code + Tests + Documentation

**Goal:** Demonstrate platform engineering skills through real implementations

**Narrative Inspiration:** The storytelling approach is inspired by Gene Kim's [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-phoenix-project/) and [The Unicorn Project](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-unicorn-project/), blending narrative with technical depth to make platform engineering concepts accessible and engaging.

**Development Approach:** All code and content has been generated with the help of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) by Anthropic, while reading [Vibe Coding](https://itrevolution.com/product/vibe-coding-book/) by Gene Kim and Steve Yegge. This project is a practical exploration of AI-assisted software development.

## The Approach

Each chapter follows a structure:
1. **Story post** - Introduces the problem through narrative
2. **Technical posts** - Deep dives with tests that prove the problem and demonstrate solutions
3. **Recap post** - Summarizes what was built and learned

Everything is built step-by-step. No jumping ahead. Each chapter must be complete before moving to the next.

## The Stack

- **Narrative:** Character-driven stories set in the restaurant tech industry
- **Code:** Real implementations in separate GitHub repositories
- **Tests:** Actual tests that prove problems exist and solutions work
- **Blog:** Jekyll-based technical writing

## Main Timeline

- **Prologue:** The SQLite monolith (establishing the broken state)
- **Chapter 1:** Infrastructure as Code
- **Chapter 2:** GitOps with ArgoCD
- **Chapter 3:** Internal Developer Portal
- **Chapter 4:** Observability Stack
- **Chapter 5:** Security Foundations
